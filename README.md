# responsive_web_page_bootstrap

This is an template for a responsive web page made with bootstrap. Contents do not have any real meaning.

It is mainly created by following https://www.udemy.com/share/105Zi23@6XQSmPVTX5LA2KcLpbSy8o7HTjitk3DenO5YGt5jkTFe2c9OR3hyQpRoB2F7KdX1/ (There are some little differences based on my own taste)

js folder and all .css files which start with bootstrap are obtained from open souurce https://getbootstrap.com/ Besides icons are from https://fontawesome.com/
index.html and style.css files are my own work
Moreover, all images can be found in the image folder.
